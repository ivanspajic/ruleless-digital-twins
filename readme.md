## Introduction
This is the accompanying artifact to the SpajiÄ‡ and Stolz 2025 DataMod paper. It consists of an ontology, instance models, an inference engine JAR and source code, inference (and verification) rules, control loop (logic) codebase, and a simulation model (FMU) and its source code.

## Running the Inference Engine
The `ruleless-digital-twins-inference-engine.jar` file (available with models and rules) should be executed from the console with 4 arguments provided:
1. The filepath of the ontology.
2. The filepath of the instance model (that uses the ontology).
3. The filepath of the inference rules. In case of multiple inference rules files, this filepath should be of the main file that includes the others.
4. The filepath of the inferred model.

If you are using multiple `.rules` files for inferencing, then you must make sure to match the `@include` directive filepaths in the main `.rules` file with the placement of the JAR file executing it. This repository contains a `verification-rules.rules` file which is included by the main `inference-rules.rules` file. This means that the filepath listed under the `@include` directive by default forces the JAR file to be executed from the same directory. Executing the JAR file from another directory will therefore require updating the filepath in the `@include` directive of the `inference-rules.rules` file.

`OptimalConditions` are meant to be used for optimal ranges of `Property` values, so the solution currently only offers support for the `>, >=, <, <=` operators being used in constraints. Note that one may define multiple constraints per `OptimalCondition`, which will be used in conjunctions for the `Property` specified. Likewise, multiple `OptimalCondition` individuals defined for the same `Property` will have their constraints applied in conjunction (and must thus adhere to verification rules). We also offer support for disjoint ranges which users can specify with disjunctions, e.g., (Protege Manchester syntax) `hasValueConstraint exactly 1 (xsd:double[< "5.4"^^xsd:double] or xsd:double[> "10.8"^^xsd:double])`.

Users are also encouraged to add their own files through the included `user-rules.rules` file.

## Docker-based example

The Dockerfile builds and runs the example inside the container. Note that `arm64` (and hence e.g. Apple Silicon) is currently not supported by one of the libraries that we depend on; see below for a workaround.
We use OpenModelica inside the container to compile the example FMU(s) into matching binaries.

```
% docker build -t smartnode -f SmartNode/SmartNode/Dockerfile SmartNode
...
=> => unpacking to docker.io/library/smartnode:latest
% docker run -v `pwd`/models-and-rules:/app/models smartnode /app/models/inferred-model-1.ttl
info: Logic.Mapek.MapekManager[0]
      Starting the MAPE-K loop.
...
```

### Run the pre-built Dockerimage from Docker Hub via emulation:

```
% docker pull volkers/smartnode
Using default tag: latest
latest: Pulling from volkers/smartnode
...
% docker run --platform linux/amd64 -v `pwd`/models-and-rules:/app/models volkers/smartnode /app/models/inferred-model-1.ttl
```

## Running the Control Loop (SmartNode)
The codebase is a .NET solution consisting of 4 projects: `Logic` (MAPE-K and models), `SensorActuatorImplementations` (for user-provided sensor/actuator implementations), `SmartNode` (startup project), and `TestProject` (unit tests). Users may choose between running the solution natively or containerized. The control loop takes a filepath representing the (inferred) instance model as an execution argument, so there are argument configurations for both kinds of executions.

The Logic project provides interfaces in the `Logic.DeviceInterfaces` directory for users to implement when providing their own custom connections to sensors and actuators. It also provides the `IValueHandler` interface for user-provided implementations of logic handling various operations with specific OWL types. The solution contains the `DoubleValueHandler`, `IntValueHandler`, and `TimespanValueHandler` as example implementations in the `SensorActuatorImplementations` project. These are registered in the `Factory` in the `SmartNode` project, where the user is expected to register other custom implementations as well.

The solution currently runs based on the example 1 instance model, found in `instance-model-1.ttl` in the `models-and-rules` directory. Running this through the inference engine produces `inferred-model-1.ttl` which is used throughout the control loop. You may also use `inferred-model-2.ttl`, representing cyber components, but note that the simulation process has not been implemented for cyber components.

The instance model contains two `OptimalConditions` that are deliberately unsatisfied by the dummy value provided by the only example sensor. Users are welcome to add their own or change the value to see the effects throughout the loop. There are many logging statements showing various stages of execution as well as the specific SPARQL queries and their results. At the end of each control loop cycle, the solution should print its chosen combination of actions to take, demonstrating what the DT's decision would be.
